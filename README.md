# Overview <a id="overview"></a>

[Triton Inference Server](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/archives/triton-inference-server-2410/user-guide/docs/user_guide/architecture.html) is
an open source fast, scalable, and open-source AI inference server, by
standardizing model deployment and execution streamlined and optimized for high
performance. The Triton Inference Server can deploy AI models such as deep
learning (DL) and machine learning (ML).

Client program initiates the inference request to Triton Inference Server.
Inference requests arrive at the server via either HTTP/REST or GRPC or by the C
API and are then routed to the appropriate per-model scheduler. Triton
implements multiple scheduling and batching algorithms that can be configured
per model-by-model basis. Each model's scheduler optionally performs batching of
inference requests and then passes the requests to the corresponding backend
module based on the model type. The backend performs inferencing using the
inputs (duly pre-processed) to produce the requested outputs. The outputs are
then returned to the client program.

A Triton backend API is provided by Triton Inference Server exposes C API and
backend libraries and frameworks in an optimized manner. This enables ONNX-MLIR
support on IBM Z.

Triton Inference Server python backend enables pre-processing, post-processing
and server models written in python programming language. This enables IBM Snap
ML support on IBM Z.

The models being served by Triton Inference Server can be queried and controlled
by a dedicated model management API that is available by HTTP/REST or GRPC
protocol, or by the C API.

From above architecture diagram, The model repository is a file-system based
repository of the models that Triton Inference Server will make available for a
deployment.

On IBM® z16™ and later (running Linux on IBM Z or IBM® z/OS® Container
Extensions (IBM zCX)), With Triton Inference server 2.33.0 python backend for IBM
Snap ML or custom backend like ONNX-MLIR will leverage new inference
acceleration capabilities that transparently target the IBM Integrated
Accelerator for AI through the
[IBM z Deep Neural Network (zDNN)](https://github.com/IBM/zDNN) library. The IBM
zDNN library contains a set of primitives that support Deep Neural Networks.
These primitives transparently target the IBM Integrated Accelerator for AI on
IBM z16 and later. No changes to the original model are needed to take advantage
of the new inference acceleration capabilities.

## Launch IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server container

Launching and maintaining IBM Z Accelerated Triton™ Inference Server revolves
around official

[quick start](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r23.12/docs/getting_started/quickstart.md)
tutorial.

This documentation will cover :

- [Creating a Model Repository](#create-model-repository)
- [Launching IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server](#start-triton-server)
- [Deploying the model](#security-and-deployment-guidelines)

## Creating a Model Repository <a id="create-model-repository"></a>

User can follow the steps describe at
[model repository](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r23.12/docs/user_guide/model_repository.md)
to create a model repository. The following steps would launch the Triton
Inference Server.

## Launching IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server <a id="start-triton-server"></a>

By default services of IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server
docker container listening at the following ports.

| Service Name                   | Port |
| ------------------------------ | :--: |
| HTTP – Triton Inference Server | 8000 |
| GRPC – Triton Inference Server | 8001 |
| HTTP – Metrics                 | 8002 |

IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server can be launched by
running the following command.

```bash
docker run --shm-size 1G --rm
    -p <EXPOSE_HTTP_PORT_NUM>:8000
    -p <EXPOSE_GRPC_PORT_NUM>:8001
    -p <EXPOSE_Metrics_PORT_NUM>:8002
    -v $PWD/models:/models <triton_inference_server_image> tritonserver
    --model-repository=/models
```

Use IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server's REST API endpoint
to verify if the server and the models are ready for inferencing. From the host
system use curl to access the HTTP endpoint that provides server status.

```bash
curl -v localhost:8000/v2/health/ready
```

```bash
...
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Length: 0
< Content-Type: text/plain
```

The HTTP request returns status 200 if IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA Triton™
Inference Server is ready and non-200 if it is not ready.

# Security and Deployment Guidelines <a id="security-and-deployment-guidelines"></a>

Once the model been available either on a system or in a
[model repository](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r23.12/docs/user_guide/model_repository.md),
model can be deployed automatically by specifying the path to the model location
while launching the Triton Inference Server.

Command to start the Triton Inference Server

```bash
docker run --shm-size 1G --rm \
    -p <TRITONSERVER_HTTP_PORT_NUM>:8000 \
    -p <TRITONSERVER_GRPC_PORT_NUM>:8001 \
    -p <TRITONSERVER_METRICS_PORT_NUM>:8002 \
    -v $PWD/models:/models <triton_inference_server_image>   tritonserver \
    --model-repository=/models
```

## Triton Inference Server using HTTPS/Secure gRPC

Configuring Triton Inference Server for HTTPS and gRPC Secure ensures secure and
encrypted communication channels, protecting clients and server data
confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

### HTTPS

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of the HTTP
protocol used for communication between clients (such as web browsers) and
servers over the internet. It provides encryption and secure data transmission
by using SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) protocols.

Reverse proxy servers can help secure Triton Inference Server communications
with HTTPS by protecting backend servers and enabling secure communication and
performance required to handle incoming request well.

The HTTPS protocol ensures that the data exchanged between the client and server
is encrypted and protected from eavesdropping or tampering. By configuring
reverse proxy server with HTTPS, you enable secure communication between the
Triton Inference Server and clients, ensuring data confidentiality and
integrity.

### Secure gRPC

Triton Inference Server supports the gRPC protocol, which is a high-performance.
gRPC provides efficient and fast communication between clients and servers,
making it ideal for real-time inferencing scenarios.

Using gRPC with Triton Inference Server offers benefits such as high
performance, bidirectional streaming, support for client and server-side
streaming, and automatic code generation for client and server interfaces.

**SSL/TLS**: gRPC support SSL/TLS and the use of SSL/TLS to authenticate the
server, and to encrypt all the data exchanged between the gRPC client and the
Triton Inference Server. Optional mechanisms are available for clients to
provide certificates for mutual authentication

# IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server Backends <a id="triton-server-backends"></a>

IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server supports two backends as
of today.

- [Python Backend](#python-backend)
- [ONNX-MLIR Backend](#onnx-mlir-backend)

## Python Backend <a id="python-backend"></a>

Python backend Triton Inference Server has a Python backend that allows you to
deploy machine learning models written in Python for inference. This backend is
known as the "Python backend" or "Python script backend."

For more details about triton python backend are documented [here](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/python_backend/tree/r23.12?tab=readme-ov-file#user-documentation)

Format of the python backend model directory looks like below

```text
$ model_1
   |-- 1
   |   |-- model.py
   |   `-- model.txt
   `-- config.pbtxt
```

### Minimal Model Configuration
Every Python Backend model must provide config.pbtxt file describing the model configuration.
Below is a sample ```config.pbtxt``` for Python Backend:

```
max_batch_size: 32
input {
  name: "IN0"
  data_type: TYPE_FP32
  dims: 5
}
output {
  name: "OUT0"
  data_type: TYPE_FP64
  dims: 1
}
backend: "python"
```
#### Configuration Parameters:
Triton Inference Server exposes some flags to control the execution mode of models through parameters section in the model’s config.pbtxt file.

- **Backend** :
   Backend parameter must be provided as “python” while utilising ONNX-MLIR Backend. For more details related to backend [here](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/backend/blob/r23.12/README.md#backends)
   
   ```
   backend: "python"
   ```
   
- **Inputs and Outputs:** : 
    Each model input and output must specify a name, datatype, and shape. The name specified for an input or output tensor must match the name expected by the model. For more details on inputs and output tensors check documentation of Triton Inference server [here](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r23.12/docs/user_guide/model_configuration.md#inputs-and-outputs)
    
For more options see [Model Configuration](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/r23.12/docs/user_guide/model_configuration.md#model-configuration).
    
Using the Python backend in Triton is especially useful for deploying custom
models or models developed with specific libraries that are not natively
supported by Triton's other backends. It provides a flexible way to bring in
your own machine learning code and integrate it with the server's inference
capabilities. It provides flexibility by allowing you to use any Python machine
learning library to define your model's inference logic.

NOTE:

1. model.py should be there in the model repository to use the python backend framework.
2. Multiple versions are supported, only positive values as version model are supported

Each model can have one or more versions. The ModelVersionPolicy property of the
model configuration is used to set one of the following policies. 

• All: Load all the versions of the model.All versions of the model that are available in the model repository are available for inferencing. `version_policy: { all: {}} `

• Latest: Only the latest ‘n’versions of the model in the repository are available for inferencing. The latest versions of the model are the numerically greatest version numbers.`version_policy: { latest: { num_versions: 2}}`

• Specific: Only the specifically listed versions of the model are available for inferencing. `version_policy: {specific: { versions: [1,3]}}` If no version policy is specified, then Latest (with n=1) is used as the default, indicating that only the most recent version of the model is made available by Triton. In all cases, the addition or removal of version subdirectories from the model repository can change which model version is used on subsequent inference requests.

### Version Policy check: All

# Limitations and Known Issues <a id="limitations-known-issues"></a>

1. Consumer of Triton Inference Server may or may not face an issue when
   utilizing Triton Inference Server with a Python backend and an HTTP endpoint
   on a Big Endian machine, experience errors related to the TYPE_STRING
   datatype. For more details, see
   [link](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/issues/5610)

2. Consumer of Triton Inference server may or may not face an issue when running
   Triton Inference Server on a Big Endian machine, specifically related to GRPC
   calls with BYTES input. It appears that the current configuration may not
   fully support GRPC calls with BYTES input. For more details, see
   [link](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/issues/5811)

3. In case, user of Triton Inference Server want restrict access the protocols
   on a given endpoint by leveraging the configuration option
   '--grpc-restricted-protocol'. This feature provides fine-grained control over
   access to various endpoints by specifying protocols and associated restricted
   keys and values. Consumer of Triton Inference server may or may not find
   similar capability for restricting endpoint access for the HTTP protocol as
   currently not available. For more details, see
   [link](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/issues/5837)

4. Consumer of Triton server will only be able to create up to 40 log files in
   total out of which 20 for protocol http and 20 for protocol grpc. For more
   details, see
   [link](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/issues/6152)

5. Consumer of Triton server may or may not face an issue while having model with
   version -1 or model.py isn't present for python backend. For more details, see
   [link](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/issues/7052)
       

# Versions and Release cadence <a id="versioning"></a>

IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server will follow the semantic
versioning guidelines with a few deviations. Overall IBM Z Accelerated for
NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server follows a continuous release model with a
cadence of 1-2 minor releases per year. In general, bug fixes will be applied to
the next minor release and not back ported to prior major or minor releases.
Major version changes are not frequent and may include features supporting new
IBM Z hardware as well as major feature changes in Triton Inference Server that
are not likely backward compatible.

## IBM Z Accelerated for for NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server versions

Each release version of IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server
has the form MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (X.Y.Z). For example, IBM Z Accelerated for
NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server version 1.2.3 has MAJOR version 1, MINOR
version 2, and PATCH version 3. Changes to each number have the following
meaning:

### MAJOR / VERSION

All releases with the same major version number will have API compatibility.
Major version numbers will remain stable. For instance, 1.Y.Z may last 1 year or
more. It will potentially have backwards incompatible changes. Code and data
that worked with a previous major release will not necessarily work with the new
release.

`Note:` pybind11 PyRuntimes, any other python packages for versions of Python
that have reached end of life can be removed or updated to newer stable version
without a major release increase change.

### MINOR / FEATURE

Minor releases will typically contain new backward compatible features,
improvements, and bug fixes.

### PATCH / MAINTENANCE

Maintenance releases will occur more frequently and depend on specific patches
introduced (e.g. bug fixes) and their urgency. In general, these releases are
designed to patch bugs.

## Release cadence

Feature releases for IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA Triton™ Inference Server
occur about every 6 months in general. Hence, IBM Z Accelerated for NVIDIA
Triton™ Inference Server X.3.0 would generally be released about 6 months after
X.2.0. Maintenance releases happen as needed in between feature releases. Major
releases do not happen according to a fixed schedule.
